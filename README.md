# Cat-vs-Dogs

Idea of a game to be tested.

Made using Unity version 2019.3.1.

Arts made by my friend Raphael Garcia.

Made this game based on a udemy course from BlackThornProd and took a few of its arts as well.

Has a lot to be done in this game, for now its just an idea and made it for the coding practice.

Game can be played in https://matefranca.itch.io/cat-vs-dogs.
